## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Cryptos are left to the volatility of the market, while people expect money to be stable. Stablecoins are bound to fiat money, which creates regulatory and other difficulties. 

1. Create a universal solution to set up a Milton Friedman-style "central bank" where the money, while never truly stable, nonetheless keeps its value around a certain X with respect to another asset or basket of assets.
2. Motivate actors to trustlessly enter the bank as liquidity providers, expecting a profit.
3. Have this central bank run wholly automatically without any government or expert oversight.

### Overview

* A solution to generate open-source stablecoin that is fully trustless, auditable, and algorithmic.  
* The first of its kind in the Polkadot environment, chronically thirsty for good stablecoins.  
* The team has already built this solution and have operated it for four years on [https://rootstock.io/], a side chain of BTC. Going to expand to Polkadot.  

### Project Details

Build a stablecoin on the Assets Pallet backed by Bitcoin (BTC) or other currencies such as Polkadot (DOT). **Start with wrapped Bitcoin (BTC) to keep the solution similar to what already works on Rootstock.**

This is not a purely algorithmic solution but a hybrid algorithmic-asset-backed system, as earlier purely algorithmic solutions failed.

The assets backing the stablecoin are kept locked in a **smart contract**, which is both completely trustless and decentralized.
No authority has access to the wallets, and the only way to release these assets is to compensate for the temporary loss of peg if it happens.

Ratio of backing is 13*1. The assets covering the stablecoin are Bitcoin (BTC) - or any other assets chosen for the new solution - and so they themselves are not stable. Room must be given for significant fluctuations of up to 80 or 90 percent downwards. That is why **over-collateralization** is a necessary element.

Build a DApp which allows an open number of users to interact with the smart contracts to:
* invest in the backing assets
* get back ROI based on calculated APR/APY
* purchase the stablecoin.
* trade the stablecoin before it becomes listed on other platforms.

As collateralization increases, more stablecoins will be released into the system keeping the 13*1 ratio. This will enable the stablecoins to hold peg even where the backing asset (BTC, DOT, etc.) loses value rapidly and significantly, e.g. in a harsh bear market. 

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

The project fits any ecosystem, because it resolves the volatility issue, common for all crypto.   

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Investors, traders, business, holders with low risk appetite, liquidity providers;  

- What need(s) does your project meet?

Stable crypto that is not a stablecoin  

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  
No. Only DEXes, but we are not a DEX.  

  - If so, how is your project different?
    
N/A  

  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
    
Yes, on RBTC, our own solution Money on Chain which we are expanding to Polkadot and porting to Substrate.

- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested.
